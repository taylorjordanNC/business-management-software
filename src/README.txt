# Business Management Application

This is a demo application to manage the appointments, contacts, customers, and employees/users within a business. Each user
is able to efficiently track their schedule and list of customers and contacts in order to operate more productively for their business.

## IDE/Language

IDE: IntelliJ Community 2020.2
JDK: Java version 14.0.2
JavaFX: JavaFX 14.0.2.1

## Instructions

Application may be started from the main thread and the appropriate 'Run' button within your default program.
You may log in with the following credentials:
Username: admin (This will give you access to every feature.)
Password: admin

OR, if you want to access the application as a non-administrative user:
Username: tough
Password: tough

Once you are logged in with appropriate credentials, you may navigate within the application to browse all users (if admin),
see all customers, contacts, and view your appointment schedule. You may also create new appointments, customers, contacts, and users (if admin), as
well as update and delete.

Within the calendar window, use the date picker to filter appointments by a specific day OR use the combo boxes to filter the appointments
by a specific month, year and week date range (month and year must be chosen before the week option is enabled). You cannot use both the date picker and combo boxes simultaneously as they are programmed separately.

Within the main window of the application, you may browse all countries and first level divisions within the company using a combo box and list view.

Additional Report: Included in the application are many additional reports and features. When browsing divisions within a country, you may generate
the list of customers for that specific division. I have also included the ability to generate the schedule for a selected contact, user, and/or customer when
clicking the appropriate 'Get Schedule' button.

In the main window, if you double click on an item in the 4-day calendar it will open up the details of that selected appointment. Additionally,
in the calendar window, if you double click an item within the calendar view or appointment table, it will open a context menu showing an option to see the details of the appointment.
If that option, 'Details', is selected, the appointment details are loaded for the user. From that details window, the user may edit or delete the appointment.

If you want to log out but keep the application open, simply click the 'Log Out' button. From there, you may log in again or exit the application.
